I have been working in application development for the past few years, building backend features and APIs.  
However, I wanted to go beyond just writing code and understand **how software actually runs, scales, and survives in production**.

This repository documents my journey from **Development to DevOps**, where I focus on understanding the **complete end-to-end production pipeline** — from code, infrastructure, deployment, automation, monitoring, and operations.

The goal of this repo is not theory, but **hands-on, practical learning** through real scripts, experiments, and documented outcomes.

As a developer, I realized that:
- Writing features is only one part of software engineering
- Production readiness, automation, and reliability are equally important
- Understanding infrastructure and operations makes better engineers

This repository represents my effort to **bridge the gap between development and production**.
This repository reflects my mindset shift from:
> **“Does the code work?”**
> **to**
> **“Is this production-ready?”**

This repository showcases my transition from development to understanding DevOps and production systems, demonstrating my interest in building **reliable, scalable, and maintainable software** beyond application code.
